    <h5>Discover Youself</h5>
    <p>Modern life often lends itself to inauthenticity--it’s easier to be inauthentic than to be vulnerable or feel judged--but spending too much time “faking it” or neglecting who you really are can leave you feeling lost and unappreciated. You might feel like you’ve lost your true self if you find yourself suddenly single, if you feel like a something’s missing from your life, or if you frequently find yourself having to act the way others want you to rather than how you really want to. So how do you rediscover yourself, the person that you know you are deep down? Fortunately, we never actually lose that person, and, by learning to change some of our habits and replace them with new ones, we can reconnect with that sense of self.</p>

        <h2>Defination Of Spirituality </h2>
        <P> Spirituality is something that’s often debated and commonly
          misunderstood. Many people confuse spirituality with religion and
          so bring pre–existing beliefs about the impact of religion to discussions
          about spirituality. Though all religions emphasise spirituality as being
          an important part of faith, it’s possible to be ‘spiritual’ without
          necessarily being a part of an organised religious community</P>

    <h2> What’s the difference between religion and
      spirituality? 
      </h2>
    <p>Spirituality and religion can be hard to tell apart but there are some pretty
      defined differences between the two.
      Religion is a specific set of organised beliefs and practices, usually shared
      by a community or group.
      Spirituality is more of an individual practice and has to do with having a
      sense of peace and purpose. It also relates to the process of developing
      beliefs around the meaning of life and connection with others.
      One way that might help you to understand the relationship between
      spirituality and religion is imagine a game of football. The rules, referees,
      other players, and field markings help guide you as you play the game in
      a similar way that religion might guide you to find your spirituality.
      Kicking the ball around a park, without having to play on the field or with
      all the rules and regulations, can also give you fulfilment and fun and still
      expresses the essence of the game, similar to spirituality in life.
      People may identify as being any combination of religious and spiritual,
      but to be religious does not automatically make you spiritual or vice–versa</p>

    <h2> Different types of spirituality?</h2>
    <p>Mystical spirituality is based around a desire to move beyond
      the material world, beyond the senses, ego and even beyond time.
      This approach centres on personal relationships and a sense of unity
      with all things. </p>
    <p>Authoritarian spirituality is a particularly strong form of spirituality
      based around a need for definition and rules. This type of spirituality
      is particularly common in specific religious practices. </p>
    <p> Intellectual spirituality focuses on building knowledge and
      understanding of spirituality through analysing history and spiritual
      theories. This approach can be found in the study of religion, also
      known as theology </p>
